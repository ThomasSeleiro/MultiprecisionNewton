function [S, its] = multiSign(A)
%MULTISIGN Computes matrix sign function in mixed single-double precision
%   Computes the matrix sign function of input matrix A using a norm scaled
%   Newton iteration in single precision. We then add a correction to the
%   result to increase its commutativity with A in double precision, and
%   perform a final double precision iteration.
